ros-hydro-topological-navigation (0.0.1-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * stupid me
  * bug fix
  * adding launch files to install targets
  * Adding install targets
  * Adding Missing TopologicalMap.msg and changing maintainer emails, names and Licences for Packages
  * Adding Execute Policy server to topological_navigation.launch
  * This version saves some basic navigation stats and has some additional comments important for documentation
  * making sure feedback is only published once per new waypoint visited
  * Adding comments and small debug
  * Moving and renaming Execute Policy Action
  * adding some sleeps to reduce computing load
  * solving current_route error
  * fixing abortion an shutdown
  * adding on shutdown actions and aborting when no edge is found
  * adding number of tries before aborting
  * other bug fix
  * fixing stupid typo
  * Making sure it navigates to the next waypoint when next action is not move_base type
  * back to unknown nodes at start
  * bug fix 3
  * removing request for outcome
  * bug fix
  * making the robot navigate to waypoint when next action is not move_base and it has previously failed
  * Making robot navigate closest edge when not at node
  * Navigating to closest node when finishing at none
  * debugging 2
  * printf for debugging
  * testing
  * setting as aborted when failed
  * Including human_aware_navigation as a move_base action on policy execution_server
  * Committing Execute policy server
  * adding sending new goals when node Iz is reached
  * Fixes bugs created by name changes of mongodb_store and moving packages between repositories
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
    Conflicts:
    topological_navigation/scripts/localisation.py
    topological_navigation/scripts/navigation.py
  * adding comment
  * scitos_ramp_climb is now ramp_climb
  * scitos_apps_msgs has been removed.
    All the imports were unused anyway.
  * Renamed ros_datacentre to mongodb_store
    This simply bulk replaces all ros_datacentre strings to mongodb_store strings inside files and also in file names.
    Needs strands-project/ros_datacentre#76 <https://github.com/strands-project/ros_datacentre/issues/76> to be merged first.
  * bug fix
  * Adding add Node controller
  * Adapting Interactive Markers on Topological Map Manager to use the topological Map Publisher
    and bug fixes.
    *WARNING: Still requires a lot of testing*
  * Topological navigation now uses topological map publisher
  * adding topological map publisher and adapting localisation node to use it
  * adding scripts to topological utils
  * adding new visualization node to launch file
  * Merge pull request #69 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/69> from BFALacerda/hydro-devel
    log of monitored nav events + improvements applied during g4s deployment
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
  * Publishing edge move via goal feedback
  * Adding Topological_map_manager
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
  * Now action server returns cancelled when the target node is not found on the map
  * outputting success imediately when source and target node are the same, when the action is not a "normal" navigtion action
  * now it is possible to edit the influence zones from rviz
  * fixing orientation reconfiguration for human aware navigation
  * Adding machine tags to launch files
  * now cancelling monitored navigation when top nav is preempted
  * Fixing bug on topological navigation server preemption
  * Minor bug fix Error Message should not appear any longer
  * Not cancelling monitored navigation goal when topological navigation produces output on Node_to_IZ mode
  * Adding Node_to_IZ
  * printing available data too
  * Added Warning when 0 or more than 1 waypoints match query for updating
  * Small fix in topological map
  * Now Topological Maps are stored in the topological_map collection
  * Now is possible to move waypoints in Rviz using interactive marker and they will be updated on the ros_datacentre
  * Making move_base care for orientation when next action is not move_base and Fixing bug when PREEMPTED
  * Adding topological map python class and edges marker array for visualisation of the topological map in Rviz
  * Fixing statistics bug
  * Preempting topological navigation when monitored navigation is preempted
  * Adding pointset to _meta information for Navigation statistics
  * Merge pull request #32 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/32> from Jailander/hydro-devel
    Using Message store proxy to store statistics and Message Name Change
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
  * Commit now vertex and Edge messages are capitalised, node message was moved to strands_navigation message
    Using Message store proxy to store statistics
  * Added param broadcast for topological map name.
  * Topological Navigation now works using message store proxy
  * changing topic name
