  * adding mongodb_store to message_store_map_switcher dependencies
  * removing mongodb_store_cpp_client from message_store_map_switcher

  * Added definition for new cxx features.
  * swapping  target link libraries to correct compilation error

  * Now using the new updateNamed method to ensure we don't get lots of maps in the database.
