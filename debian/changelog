ros-hydro-topological-utils (0.0.5-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation into hydro-devel
    Conflicts:
    topological_utils/CMakeLists.txt
  * adding install targets
  * adding joystick creation of topological map
  * Added launch file for dummy topological navigation and install targets.
  * Added dummy script to stand in for topological navigation when missing a robot or proper simulation.
    Useful for testing.
  * Adding licences and bug fix
  * Moved Vertex and Edge into strands_navigation_msgs.
    Basic test for travel_time_tester passes.

ros-hydro-topological-utils (0.0.2-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * 0.0.1
  * added changelogs
  * Adding install targets
  * including visualization_msgs in package xml to sort #83 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_navigation/issues/83>
  * Adding Missing TopologicalMap.msg and changing maintainer emails, names and Licences for Packages
  * scitos_apps_msgs has been removed.
    All the imports were unused anyway.
  * Renamed datacentre_ rosparams to mongodb_
  * Renamed ros_datacentre to mongodb_store
    This simply bulk replaces all ros_datacentre strings to mongodb_store strings inside files and also in file names.
    Needs strands-project/ros_datacentre#76 <https://github.com/strands-project/ros_datacentre/issues/76> to be merged first.
  * Adding add Node controller
  * adding scripts to topological utils
  * Adding Topological_map_manager
  * now it is possible to edit the influence zones from rviz
  * Adding an script for exporting the map to a text file
  * Now Station is connected to WayPoint1 through undocking
    ... not docking
  * Improved waypoint to tmap script
    Now when creating the topological map from a waypoint file it will add a
    Charging node (ChargingPoint) at position {0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
    (this waypoint can't be on the waypoint file) and this node will
    be conected to the first waypoint in the file only using the
    docking action
  * Adding Node_to_IZ
  * Small fix in topological map
  * Now Topological Maps are stored in the topological_map collection
  * Now is possible to move waypoints in Rviz using interactive marker and they will be updated on the ros_datacentre
  * Adding topological map python class and edges marker array for visualisation of the topological map in Rviz
  * Adding interactive markers to visualization
  * Adding visualise_map.py tool
  * adding max distance for edge creation between topological nodes
  * Commit now vertex and Edge messages are capitalised, node message was moved to strands_navigation message
    Using Message store proxy to store statistics
  * Topological Navigation now works using message store proxy
  * adding node message and move base reconfigure
  * preliminary switch to ros_datacentre
  * Adding Topological_Utils to repository
